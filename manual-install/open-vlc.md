# Open VLC instead of apple music

brew install --cask notunes - so that you dont launch itunes/apple music

VLC: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html
you also need to reassign the default music player for music files to QuickTime or VLC - the usual way of “Always Open With” never works, you have to do this: Select any MP3 file, Press "Command+i", Change "Open with:" to VLC, Click the "Change All…" button. Tada.
